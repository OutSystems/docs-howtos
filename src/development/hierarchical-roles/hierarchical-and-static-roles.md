# Hierarchical and static roles comparison

This section shows a comparison between hierarchical roles and the default roles in OutSystems apps.

## Advantages of hierarchical roles

The following bullets show the advantages of defining hierarchical roles:

* Accommodates hierarchical authorization 

* Accommodates potential explosion of application roles

* Allows runtime configuration of roles (for example, renaming, screen mapping)

## What you should take into consideration

Consider the following when defining hierarchical roles:

* Effective runtime configuration depends on implementation. Plan the delivery of incremental functionality instead of unnecessary blocks.
* Configuration overhead for setting up the security model to each scheme flow: plan for end-user training and assistance, or improved UX (for example, contextual help).
* Performance penalty due to database query on every screen access: load the user’s authorization model into session upon login. This may bring additional challenges to data structure mapping and size.
* Security risk due to manual inclusion of authorization checks: consider using authorization actions inside a web block present in the base layout.
* Lack of built-in product support: plan for extensive unit and component testing. Create the necessary support elements enumeration needs (static entities, actions, etc.).

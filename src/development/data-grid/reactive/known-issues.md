# Known Issues 

This list contains known issues currently being investigated by OutSystems. You can use it to see if an issue affecting you is already known and decide when to upgrade.If you have any questions, comments, or need some assistance you can post a question on the [Support tab of the Forge component](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-discussions/9764/Data+Grid+Reactive). 

## Copying and Exporting an Action Column with fixed text to CSV and Excel not working

* When you have an Action Column that uses the TextFixed input parameter, the value set in the input doesn't show when you copy the cell or when the row is exported to CSV or Excel.

    **Status:** We are currently trying to understand how we can implement this without affecting the data grid performance.

## Pasting a value in a Number Column that has the Min or Max parameter set does not trigger validation

* When the validation is not triggered, it causes the column to have an invalid value according to the specification.
    
    **Status:** We are currently trying to understand how we can implement this without affecting the data grid performance.

    **Temporary workaround:** Validate the changed data before sending it to the server.

## Using the SearchData block or API and using a filter in a column that cleans all data will clear all filters

* When using the SearchData block or API to do a search in the data grid without going to the server side displays the results in the grid. If, after a search, the user adds a filter to a column that removes all data, the filters will reset and all data is shown in the grid.

    **Status:** We are currently finding the root cause.

## Using the animation class on a container around the Grid block causes a horizontal scroll on the screen

* If you add the data grid to a container that has CSS animations, the screen displays a horizontal scroll.

    **Status:** We are currently finding the root cause.

## OnInitialize event issue when using autogenerated columns and using JS with provider.columns.

* When using the OnInitialize event issue in an autogenerated column causes an error on the second load if you have any JS block that uses the variable provider.columns.
    
    **Status:** We are still determining if this is a situation that could be common. For now it is considered an edge case.

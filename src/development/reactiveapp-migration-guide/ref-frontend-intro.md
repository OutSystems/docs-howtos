# Front-end migration introduction

This document provides information about migrating the Front-end from Traditional Web Apps to Reactive Web Apps. Front-end comprises:

* User Interface
* Layout
* Themes and Styles
* UI flow elements
* Screens
* Blocks.

When migrating the frontend of your Traditional Web App, start by creating the front-end structure of your screens first, and then migrate the UI and the components of each screen.

Continue to [User Interface](<ref-frontend-ui.md>) to learn about migrating the UI.

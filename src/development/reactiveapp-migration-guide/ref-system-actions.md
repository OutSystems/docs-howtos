# Systems Actions

If there's no equivalent Client Action to the Server Action you want to use, consider the following:

* Wrapping a System Action into a Server Action, keeping in mind the performance implications.

* Creating a [custom JavaScript implementation](https://success.outsystems.com/Documentation/11/Extensibility_and_Integration/JavaScript/Extend_Your_Mobile_and_Reactive_Apps_Using_JavaScript).

For more ideas and examples, check the [Reactive Utilities](https://www.outsystems.com/forge/component-overview/1730/reactive-utilities) Forge component by the OutSystems community.

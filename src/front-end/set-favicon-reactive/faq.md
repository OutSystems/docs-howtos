# How to change a favicon

This document explains how to change the default icon and replace it by your favicon. OutSystems apps use the OutSystems logo as the default favicon from Service Studio > **Data** > **Resources** > **favicon.png**.

When changing the favicon, keep in mind that you need to:

* Change the favicon file in **all modules** that expose screens in your app
* Reload the app data, to ensure the app loads the new favicon. If you are using Chrome, right-click the tab with your app and select **Reload**. You can also clear the entire browser cache.
* Make sure your icon [follows the guidelines](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/favicon-in-search) if you want the favicon to show on Google search results.
